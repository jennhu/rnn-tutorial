    "**TODO**: transition to explaining LSTMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many applications use a special type of RNN called a **long short-term memory (LSTM)** network. We'll call non-LSTM RNNs \"vanilla RNNs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. LSTMs: Beyond vanilla RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate the popularity of LSTMs, recall why we were interested in RNNs in the first place: modeling *sequences*. The idea is that items at later parts of a sequence can depend on items at earlier parts of the sequence. The distance between these related items is often called the **dependency length**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency lengths can be quite short in some cases and quite long in others, even for the same task. Returning to the language example, suppose your task is to predict the last word in a sentence. If your sentence is \n",
    "\n",
    "> A car has four *wheels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "then the gap between the target word (here, \"wheels\") and the relevant parts of the sequence (here, \"car\") is relatively small. In contrast, consider the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "> A car can have sentimental value for many owners for a variety of reasons, and can come in many models, sizes, and colors; nevertheless, one defining characteristic of such a machine is that it has four *wheels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the gap between \"wheels\" and \"car\" is relatively large. Words closer to the end of the sentence such as \"machine\" and \"four\" can help guide the prediction of \"wheels\", but we need the word \"car\" to nail down the correct word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, vanilla RNNs are able to capture these dependencies of any length, but in practice, they often fail on long-term dependencies ([Bengio et al. 1994](http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it/paolo//ps/tnn-94-gradient.pdf)). LSTMs ([Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735)) turn out to be an effective solution to this problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we've learned how to train our own small LSTM, let's examine the behavior of an LSTM that has already been pre-trained on a larger amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will be playing around with a **language model**. A language model assigns a probability distribution over words. It is trained to perform the following task: at each point in a sentence, predict the most probable next word given the preceding context. For example, if the first word of a sentence is \"The\", then a reasonable language model might assign high probabilities to nouns (e.g. \"dog\" or \"boy\") and low probabilities to verbs (e.g. \"swims\" or \"sings\") as the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we evaluate whether a language model has successfully \"learned\" English grammar, aside from using our intuition? One thing we can do is test the language model on some basic grammatical phenomena, such as **subject-verb agreement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Subject-verb agreement\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, every well-formed sentence has a **subject** and a **verb**. For example, in the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1) The dog sniffs a bone.\n",
    "\n",
    "*dog* is the subject, and *sniffs* is the verb. The subject and verb must **agree** in **number** -- that is, a singular subject must be paired with a singular verb, and a plural subject must be paired with a plural verb. Returning to our example, this simply means that\n",

    "> (1) The dog sniffs a bone.\n",

    "> (2) The dogs sniff a bone.\n",

    "> (4) \\*The dogs sniffs a bone.\n",

    "are not. (That's what the asterisk means!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Evaluation metric\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this relate to LSTM language models? The key assumption is that a language model that has successfully \"learned\" English should assign **higher probability** to grammatically well-formed sentences (\"grammatical\"), and **lower probability** to grammatically ill-formed sentences (\"ungrammatical\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a metric for evaluating our language model. Recall that language models assign probabilities at the level of each word. So a successful model should assign\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "P(\\text{singular verb }|\\text{ singular subject}) &> P(\\text{plural verb }|\\text{ singular subject}) \\\\\n",

    "P(\\text{sniff }|\\text{ The dogs}) &> P(\\text{sniffs }|\\text{ The dogs}).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for reasons beyond the scope of this tutorial, psycholinguists are typically interested in the **negative log probability** of words, as [it is better correlated with human behavioral measures](https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/papers/smith-levy-2013-cognition.pdf). Since this quantity is known as **surprisal**, let's denote it by $S$. This means that we will equivalently be looking for the pattern \n",
