    "The basic RNN model worked well for this example, but in practice, many applications use a special type of RNN called a **long short-term memory (LSTM)** network. From now on, we'll call non-LSTM RNNs \"vanilla RNNs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. LSTMs: Beyond vanilla RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate the popularity of LSTMs, recall why we were interested in RNNs in the first place: modeling *sequences*. The idea is that items at later parts of a sequence can depend on items at earlier parts of the sequence. The distance between these related items is often called the **dependency length**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency lengths can be quite short in some cases and quite long in others, even for the same task. Returning to the language example, suppose your task is to predict the last word in a sentence. If your sentence is \n",
    "\n",
    "> A car has four *wheels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "then the gap between the target word (here, \"wheels\") and the relevant parts of the sequence (here, \"car\") is relatively small. In contrast, consider the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "> A car can have sentimental value for many owners for a variety of reasons, and can come in many models, sizes, and colors; nevertheless, one defining characteristic of such a machine is that it has four *wheels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the gap between \"wheels\" and \"car\" is relatively large. Words closer to the end of the sentence such as \"machine\" and \"four\" can help guide the prediction of \"wheels\", but we need the word \"car\" to nail down the correct word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, vanilla RNNs are able to capture these dependencies of any length, but in practice, they often fail on long-term dependencies ([Bengio et al. 1994](http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it/paolo//ps/tnn-94-gradient.pdf)). LSTMs ([Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735)) turn out to be an effective solution to this problem.\n",

It is trained to perform the following task: at each point in a sentence, predict the most probable next word given the preceding context. For example, if the first word of a sentence is \"The\", then a reasonable language model might assign high probabilities to nouns (e.g. \"dog\" or \"boy\") and low probabilities to verbs (e.g. \"swims\" or \"sings\") as the next word.\n",

    "Finally, for reasons beyond the scope of this tutorial, psycholinguists are typically interested in the **negative log probability** of words, as [it is better correlated with human behavioral measures](https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/papers/smith-levy-2013-cognition.pdf).
